`Every new piece moves through a quick pipeline, shown on its blurred card:

1. UPLOADING — your image is transferred securely
2. ALMOST DONE — the piece is being published
3. LIVE ✓ — a green check flashes and the real card takes over

There is no review step in between: your artwork goes live the moment it finishes publishing. Tap the blurred card anytime to open the full step-by-step status. It usually takes just a few seconds.`

        question: "Why did my upload fail?",

`Uploads are not reviewed, so a failure is a technical one. The popup tells you the exact reason:

1. Merit below 80 — uploads pause until your merit recovers (+2/day)
2. The file could not be transferred — connection dropped, or the image is too large
3. You were signed out mid-upload — sign back in and try again

Nothing is published on a failed upload, and any transferred file is removed from storage automatically. Fix the issue and upload again whenever you're ready.`

`Yes — one piece can hold several images:

1. In the upload form, use "Add more images (optional)"
2. The first image stays the cover and thumbnail
3. Add as many extras as you like
4. Viewers swipe through them in the full-size viewer

Great for variants, close-ups, or step-by-step process shots.`

`When uploading:

1. Add up to 10 tags that describe the piece (style, subject, colors)
2. Pick the software you used from the dropdown
3. Good tags help people discover your work in search

Keep tags relevant — spammy tags can get flagged.`

`To manage a piece you posted:

1. Open your Profile and go to Settings
2. Tap "Edit My Work"
3. Find the piece — use ✎ Edit to update it or ✕ Delete to remove it

Edits save instantly; deleting also removes the image file from storage.`

4. Confirm you're logged in, reload, and try once more
5. Still failing? Contact DigiArtzsupport@gmail.com with the file details

A failed upload never leaves a half-published piece — storage is cleaned up automatically.`

• Premium — 15 per day
• Max — 20 per day

Your allowance resets every day at midnight UTC, and downloading your own
